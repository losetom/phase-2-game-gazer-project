SAVING YOUR WORK REMOTELY 

- Any work done on the project is still only on the local machine so it would need to be added, committed, and pushed to the remote repository. 

- Use the following commands to do so:

`git add .`

`git commit -m "Commit Comment"`

`git push`

FUTURE FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY 

- Pricing of games should be added to show what is on sale or what is new. Another feature could include when the game was created and what systems the game is available on.
